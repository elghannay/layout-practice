        <h2>LEARN ABOUT RADON</h2>
        <h3>Radon is a cancer-causing, radioactive gas</h3>
        <p>
          You can't see radon. You can't smell radon. You can't taste radon. But
          radon may be a problem in your home. Radon causes thousands of deaths
          each year. The Surgeon General has warned that radon is the second
          leading cause of lung cancer in the United States. Only smoking causes
          more lung cancer deaths.
        </p>
        <h3>Radon can be found all over the U.S.</h3>
        <p>
          Radon comes from the natural (radioactive) breakdown of uranium in
          soil, rock, and water and gets into the air you breathe. Radon can be
          found all over the U.S. and can get into any type of building — homes,
          offices, and schools. You and your family are most likely to get your
          greatest exposure at home, where you spend most of your time.
        </p>
        <h3>You should test for radon</h3>
        <p>
          Testing is the only way to know if you and your family are at risk
          from radon. The EPA and the Surgeon General recommend testing all
          homes. Testing is inexpensive and easy. It will only take a few
          minutes of your time.

      <p>
        Nearly 1 out of every 15 homes in the U.S. is estimated to have elevated
        radon levels. Elevated levels of radon gas have been found in homes in
        Fresno, Clovis, surrounding San Joaquin Valley homes, and in homes in
        the Sierra Mountains. While radon problems may be more common in some
        areas, any home may have a problem. The only way to know about your home
        is to test.

        <h3>Radon measurement</h3>
        <p>
          Radon is measured in picocuries per liter (pCi/L). If your radon level
          is 4 pCi/L or higher, the EPA and the Surgeon General recommend that
          you fix your home. Radon levels less than 4 pCi/L still poses a risk
          which, in many cases, may be reduced. The EPA believes that any radon
          exposure carries risk - no level of radon is safe. Even radon levels
          below 4 pCi/L pose some risk, and you can reduce your risk of lung
          cancer by lowering your radon level.
        </p>

        <p>
          The average indoor radon level is estimated to be about 1.3 pCi/L.
          About 0.4 pCi/L of radon is normally found in the outside air. The
          U.S. Congress has set a long-term goal that indoor radon levels be no
          more than outdoor levels. While this goal is not yet achievable in all
          cases, most homes today can be reduced to 2 pCi/L or below.
        </p>
